    <summary>Workflowy is a web-based outliner to organize your brain</summary>
    <description>WorkFlowy is a simple organizational tool that enables users 
    to create personal to-do lists, take notes, and many more. 
    It is a text-based, zoomable bulleted list that is very flexible in allowing users
    to organize ideas in any way they want. 
    It is a notebook for lists which can be separated or categorized as lists for goals,
    projects, to-dos, ideas, links and others. It is completely searchable, and by zooming
    on a particular list or word, users can drill down to focus on that item alone.
